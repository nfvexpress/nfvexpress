# NFV Express
NFV Express is an open-source R&D project dedicated to build a scalable cloud computing platform based on OpenStack for FreeBSD Operating System started in October, 2016.

# R&D iterations
Each R&D iteration lasts for three months.
Currenly after ending the first iteration it became possible to start exploring OpenStack on FreeBSD, perform basic tasks like managing users in keystone, upload images to glance, spin-up virtual machines and connect to them via SSH or VNC in the Dashboard from your browser.


## Q4 2016
Done:
- Ported client libraries and clients for OpenStack services (python-openstackclient)
- Ported Keystone (authentication and authorization service for OpenStack services)
- Ported Glance (stores and retrieves virtual machine disk images)
- Ported Nova (manages the lifecycle of compute instances in an OpenStack environment)
- Ported Horizon (web-based dashboard and portal for OpenStack)
- Ported Cinder (persistent block storage to running instances)
- Platform-specific fixes to use Xen Dom0 as hypervisor for Nova
- Networking driver for FreeBSD (nova-network's freebsd_net)
- Floating IP support for Nova using PF
- Initial NFS support for Cinder
- Submitted all ports to the FreeBSD ports tree

## Q1 2017 (ongoing)
Done:
- Documentation for OpenStack on FreeBSD
- Installation scripts for single-node OpenStack deployment
- Binary packages with default options from FreeBSD ports tree to speed up the installation of OpenStack (building from sources takes up four hours)
- Fixing serial console
- FreeBSD 11 cloud images to use on FreeBSD (Xen and QEMU flavors)

In Progress:
- Stabilizing core services
- Preparing for OpenStack Ocata
- Make a FreeBSD ports tree consistent
- Security groups

## Backlog
- Migrate to Ocata
- Backport nova-network to Ocata
- ZFS support for block storage
- iSCSI drivers with multipath support
- Live migrations and quick snapshots
- Neutron service, support for rich network topologies
- VLANs and QoS
- Security groups
- Performance monitoring using Ceilometer
- Port Database as a Service (Trove)
- Port Elastic Map Reduce (Sahara)
- Port OpenStack Orchestration (Heat)
- Add support for bhyve hypervisor
