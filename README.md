# NFV Express
NFV Express is an open-source R&D project dedicated to build a scalable cloud computing platform based on OpenStack for FreeBSD Operating System started in October, 2016.

# R&D iterations
Each R&D iteration lasts for three months.
Currenly after ending the first phase it's possible to start exploring OpenStack on FreeBSD, perform basic tasks like managing users in keystone, upload images to glance, spin-up virtual machines and connect to them via SSH or VNC in the Dashboard from your browser.


## Q4 2016
Done:
- ported python-openstackclient, keystone, glance
- ported nova with initial support of Xen and QEMU hypervisors
- ported cinder with initial support for NFS volumes
- ported nova-network
- ported horizon (OpenStack Dashboard)
- submitted all ports to the FreeBSD ports tree

## Q1 2017 (ongoing)
Done:
- Documentation for OpenStack on FreeBSD
- Installation scripts for single-node OpenStack deployment
- Binary packages with default options from FreeBSD ports tree to speed up the installation of OpenStack (building from sources takes up four hours)
- Fixing serial console
- FreeBSD 11 cloud images to use on FreeBSD (Xen and QEMU flavors)

In Progress:
- Stabilizing core services
- Preparing for OpenStack Ocata
- Make a FreeBSD ports tree consistent
- Security groups

## Q2-Q3 2017
Planning:
- Migrate to Ocata
- Port of Neutron service with support of FIBs and security groups via PF (rewrite linuxbridge driver)
- ZFS driver for Cinder
- Multipath device support
- Snapshots and migrations
- Port other services like Trove, Heat
- Submitting a proposal to OpenStack Project to become an upstream project
- Add support for bhyve hypervisor
